## Introduction

Our team of four members developed this web application as the final project for a program organized by Projectstake Academy in collaboration with CS50. The project aims to evaluate our understanding of learned concepts and our ability to apply them to solve real-world problems.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/School-pro/CS50b.git`
2. Navigate to the backend directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To use the project, execute the following commands:

1. Start the server: `npm run watch`
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Tailwind CSS
4. JavaScript
5. Node.js
6. Express
7. MongoDB

## Note:

Currently, the app utilizes the MongoDB connection string that I've provided here. However, if you're accessing this or cloning it after one month from submission, please note that the connection string will be removed.

To prevent any issues when running the app, ensure that you create a database named 'ToDoApp' and a collection named 'itemy'. Retrieve the connection string and replace the password placeholder with your own password. Additionally, remember to whitelist the API to permit access from all locations.

If you're unsure about any of these steps, refer to the MongoDB documentation for further guidance.
